Manage Github Repositories Secrets

## why mrgs ?

I have used [Infisical](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical) but I have not found what I was looking for : a simple solution to manage my personal Github repo secrets. So I made my own. It is made using Nuxt 3, NuxtUi and Supabase. I have speed runned this in like two weeks so it is far from perfect. 

## Any issue or collobation ?

I am open to anything ;)

##Â TODO

- [ ] Automatize because user needs to manually install the app to provide access to all repositories
